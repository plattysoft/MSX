# MSX
playing around with MSX Basic. It is a bit of a mess, but there a few interesting projects

## Full games
* Raftoid: Arkanoid / Breakout style concept with a level editor (MSXDev 2020)
* LOGIC: Platformer (MSXDev 2021)

## PoCs
* Isometric engine PoC
* Flappy bird concept
* Smooth Scrolling test using the VPD and remapping the VRAM

## Work In progress
* SpaceCat: Lander with a cat on a flying saucer (inspired by the Android game) 
* Raftoid Revenge: Conceptual breakout mixed with shoot-em-up
* I-LOGIC: Follow up

All these can be compiled to run with MSX-Basic-Kun, which is an amazing runtime compiler
