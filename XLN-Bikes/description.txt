Design decisions:

Given color clash, I had the choice:
* Allow free grid, allow color clash, which looked really bad
* Allow free grid, both players use the same color, which looked boring
* Restric the grid to 8 pixels

With a restricted grid, I felt like it needed guiding lines, which took almost 2 entire lines to draw

Next decision was to start from the same place or randomize it.

The actual decision was what to use the code for, it was grid, random start, and sound effects
And I could only setup 2 of the 3, so I decided the random start was giving the game a bit more fun into making games different
Also, the grid was necessary to allow good gameplay

Finally, debouncing.

Things I wanted but didn't have space for
* Crash "animation"
* Sounds


Move with turns Vs move with stick directions, it is a lot easier with stick directions, no need to debouce

S=STICK(0):IFSMOD2=1ANDS+D<>6ANDS+D<>10THEND=S

to prevent U turns, from Stick 1 to 5 and 3 to 7, and the other way around, we can just add the values and check
