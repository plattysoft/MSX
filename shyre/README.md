I intend to make a game that is inspired by Sokoban and Eggerland Mistery while having puzzles that take several rooms, like having a key far away from the key, in a style close to what a dungeon on the first Zelda feels like, without the combat.

Our main character is an astronaut that is exploring some alien ruins when an electric storm traps them in the planet.

Now they need to find the highest possible place where the teleport can have a lock at them, and there seems to be a tall building ahead, which looks similar to the an Aztec Pyramid.

Their fate now dependes on you.

Yes, I have played too many Zelda games and watched too much Star Trek
